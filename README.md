# Library-Management-System
Hey everyone, this was my university project for the course I was enrolled in. I submitted the project at this level to the teacher but I feel and I am pretty sure that there could be more added in it and there are better and effective ways to solve the problems. I need your contributions and guidance about what should I add and how one complex part of the code can be done in a simpler way. I am not professional coder just an amateur. Any kind of tip and advice is appreciated.

The project consists of two parts.
Part One is selected by entering "1".
In part one, we have an option to:
1. Register members by pressing "A"
2. Check and issue a book by pressing "B". When you are done then enter: "no more books" to exit.
3. To display member's information by pressing "C".
4. In the end press "E" to exit.

Now if you press "2", Part two is selected.
In part two, it consists of:
1. Register or Add books by pressing "A". Some of the books are already hardcoded.
2. Check books if it is present in the library by pressing "B".
3. Check author by pressing "C".
4. Check category by pressing "D".
5. Press "E" to exit.
